// The asset lock.
//
// There is no bundler here, so the `?v=N` on every URL is the only thing that
// makes a browser fetch a file it already holds. "Bump N when a served file
// changes" is a rule a person has to remember, and on 2026-09-04 a person did
// not: v1.3.0 shipped a rewritten `src/exporters.js` and three rewritten locale
// files under the `?v=11` they had carried since v1.2.0. GitHub Pages serves
// those with `cache-control: max-age=600`, so a returning browser kept the old
// modules for the length of that window and produced a v1.2.0 CSV from a v1.3.0
// page. Nothing broke loudly, which is the problem: it was a silent downgrade.
//
// This file turns the rule into an artefact. `assets.lock.json` records the
// version and a hash of every file the `?v=` covers. `tests/cachebust.test.mjs`
// fails when the tree and the lock disagree, and `--write` below REFUSES to
// record a changed hash under an unchanged version, which is the one case the
// comparison alone cannot tell apart: without that refusal, relocking would be a
// way to make the failure go away without fixing it.
//
// The workflow after editing anything served:
//
//   1. bump ?v= in index.html and in every relative import (they must agree)
//   2. node tests/assets-lock.mjs --write
//
// Lock LAST, once, just before committing. Editing a served file after locking
// makes the writer refuse until N moves again, which is correct but blunt: it
// cannot tell an uncommitted edit from a shipped one. The numbers are free, so
// the answer is simply to bump again rather than to weaken the rule.
//
// What it does NOT cover: `fonts/`. Those are referenced from `style.css` by a
// bare path with no version, so a font replaced under the same filename would be
// cached regardless of what the lock said. Locking them would promise a
// protection that is not there. They have never changed; if one ever does, it
// needs a new filename, not a new N.
